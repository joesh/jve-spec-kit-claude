```

## Commands
```bash
# Build system
make                 # Build all targets including JVEEditor application
make clean          # Clean build artifacts

# Run the application
./bin/JVEEditor      # Launch professional video editor (FULLY FUNCTIONAL)

# Testing (88.9% success rate)
./bin/test_command_execute    # Timeline operations (PASSING)
./bin/test_command_undo       # Undo/redo system (PASSING) 
./bin/test_selection_system   # Multi-selection (PASSING)
./bin/test_timeline_operations # Timeline command tests (PASSING)
./bin/test_media_import       # Media import system (PASSING)
./bin/test_project_create     # Project creation (PASSING)
./bin/test_project_load       # Project loading (PASSING)
./bin/test_sequence_create    # Sequence management (PASSING)
./bin/test_clip_selection     # Clip selection API (1 FAILURE - deterministic UUIDs)
```

## Code Style
C++ (Qt6) + Lua (LuaJIT) hybrid architecture: Follow standard conventions
- Qt6 coding conventions with qCDebug logging
- Professional video editing patterns (Avid/FCP7/Resolve)
- TDD methodology with contract-first testing
- Professional UI component architecture
