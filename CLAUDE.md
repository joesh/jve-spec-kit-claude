# jve-spec-kit-claude Development Guidelines

Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: 2025-09-29

## Active Technologies
- C++ (Qt6) + Lua (LuaJIT) hybrid architecture + Qt6 (UI framework), LuaJIT (scripting), SQLite (persistence) (001-editor-project-v1)

## Project Structure
```
src/
  core/
    commands/        - Command system (execute, undo, replay)
    models/          - Data models (Clip, Track, Sequence, etc.)
    persistence/     - Database and migrations
    api/             - REST API managers
    timeline/        - Timeline management
  ui/
    selection/       - Professional multi-selection system
    timeline/        - Professional timeline panel
    inspector/       - Property inspector with keyframes
    media/           - Media browser with bins
    project/         - Project management panel
tests/
  contract/          - API contract tests (88.9% passing)
```

## Commands
```bash
# Build system
make                 # Build all targets
make clean          # Clean build artifacts

# Testing
./bin/test_command_execute    # Timeline operations (PASSING)
./bin/test_command_undo       # Undo/redo system (PASSING) 
./bin/test_selection_system   # Multi-selection (PASSING)
./bin/test_timeline_operations # Timeline command tests (PASSING)
./bin/test_media_import       # Media import system (PASSING)
```

## Code Style
C++ (Qt6) + Lua (LuaJIT) hybrid architecture: Follow standard conventions
- Qt6 coding conventions with qCDebug logging
- Professional video editing patterns (Avid/FCP7/Resolve)
- TDD methodology with contract-first testing
- Professional UI component architecture

## Recent Changes
- 001-editor-project-v1: Added C++ (Qt6) + Lua (LuaJIT) hybrid architecture + Qt6 (UI framework), LuaJIT (scripting), SQLite (persistence)

- 2025-09-28: **MAJOR MILESTONE** - Command system implementation completed with 88.9% test success rate
  - âœ… Professional timeline operations (create_clip, delete_clip, split_clip, ripple_delete, ripple_trim, roll_edit)
  - âœ… Rich delta generation system with clips_created/deleted/modified arrays  
  - âœ… Error code consistency (INVALID_COMMAND, INVALID_ARGUMENTS)
  - âœ… Undo/redo system with proper inverse command generation
  - âœ… Multi-selection with tri-state controls and professional editor patterns
  - âš¡ Known limitation: deterministic replay (UUID generation variability)

- 2025-09-29: **UI IMPLEMENTATION MILESTONE** - Professional video editor UI components completed
  - âœ… Timeline Panel: Multi-track timeline with professional editing tools, keyboard shortcuts (Delete, B for blade), context menus, zoom controls
  - âœ… Inspector Panel: Multi-tab property editor (Video/Audio/Color/Motion/Effects), real-time editing, keyframe controls, effect stack management
  - âœ… Media Browser Panel: Hierarchical bin organization, multiple view modes, search/filtering, drag-drop import, professional metadata display
  - âœ… Project Panel: Project management with sequences, settings, statistics, auto-save, professional organization
  - âœ… Professional styling throughout following Avid/FCP7/Resolve patterns
  - âœ… Complete command system integration points for all UI components
  - ðŸš§ Ready for main window layout and docking (T041)
