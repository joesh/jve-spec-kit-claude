Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: 2025-09-29

## Active Technologies
- C++ (Qt6) + Lua (LuaJIT) hybrid architecture + Qt6 (UI framework), LuaJIT (scripting), SQLite (persistence) (001-editor-project-v1)

## Project Structure
```
src/
  core/
    commands/        - Command system (execute, undo, replay)
    models/          - Data models (Clip, Track, Sequence, etc.)
    persistence/     - Database and migrations
    api/             - REST API managers
    timeline/        - Timeline management
  ui/
    main/            - Main window with professional docking layout
    selection/       - Professional multi-selection system
    timeline/        - Professional timeline panel
    inspector/       - Property inspector with keyframes
    media/           - Media browser with bins
    project/         - Project management panel
  main.cpp           - Application entry point
bin/
  JVEEditor          - Executable professional video editor
tests/
  contract/          - API contract tests (88.9% passing)
```

## Commands
```bash
# Build system
make                 # Build all targets including JVEEditor application
make clean          # Clean build artifacts

# Run the application
./bin/JVEEditor      # Launch professional video editor (FULLY FUNCTIONAL)

# Testing (88.9% success rate)
./bin/test_command_execute    # Timeline operations (PASSING)
./bin/test_command_undo       # Undo/redo system (PASSING) 
./bin/test_selection_system   # Multi-selection (PASSING)
./bin/test_timeline_operations # Timeline command tests (PASSING)
./bin/test_media_import       # Media import system (PASSING)
./bin/test_project_create     # Project creation (PASSING)
./bin/test_project_load       # Project loading (PASSING)
./bin/test_sequence_create    # Sequence management (PASSING)
./bin/test_clip_selection     # Clip selection API (1 FAILURE - deterministic UUIDs)
```

## Code Style
C++ (Qt6) + Lua (LuaJIT) hybrid architecture: Follow standard conventions
- Qt6 coding conventions with qCDebug logging
- Professional video editing patterns (Avid/FCP7/Resolve)
- TDD methodology with contract-first testing
- Professional UI component architecture

## Recent Changes
- 001-editor-project-v1: Added C++ (Qt6) + Lua (LuaJIT) hybrid architecture + Qt6 (UI framework), LuaJIT (scripting), SQLite (persistence)
