# Playhead Restoration Invariant

**Date:** 2025-10-09
**Status:** ✅ Implemented and Verified

---

## The Core Invariant

**Each command record represents a complete state checkpoint AFTER that command completes.**

```
State(N) = replay(commands[1..N])
```

When you undo/redo to position N, you get the **exact state** that existed after command N finished executing—including:
- All clips created/modified/deleted by that command
- Playhead position after that command's effects
- Selection state after that command's effects

---

## Why This Invariant Matters

This design treats the command history as a **timeline of complete states**, not a log of incremental changes. Each point in history is a full snapshot of "where you were" at that moment.

### Text Editor Analogy

```
Initial: ""
Type "Hello" → "Hello" (cursor at position 5)
Type " World" → "Hello World" (cursor at position 11)
Undo → "Hello" (cursor at position 5)  ← Full state restored
Undo → "" (cursor at position 0)       ← Initial state restored
```

The cursor position is part of each state checkpoint, not separate from it.

### JVE Editor Implementation

```
Initial: playhead=0ms, clips=[]
F9 (INSERT) → playhead=3000ms, clips=[clip1(0-3000)]
F9 (INSERT) → playhead=6000ms, clips=[clip1, clip2(3000-6000)]
Undo → playhead=3000ms, clips=[clip1]  ← Full state restored
Undo → playhead=0ms, clips=[]           ← Initial state restored
```

The playhead position is part of each state checkpoint, not separate from it.

## Implementation Details

### State Capture Timing (Critical)

The state must be captured **AFTER** the command's side effects complete:

```lua
-- command_manager.lua execute() flow:
function M.execute(command)
    -- 1. Calculate pre-hash (for verification)
    local pre_hash = calculate_state_hash()

    -- 2. Execute the command (may modify clips, playhead, etc.)
    local success = execute_command_implementation(command)

    if success then
        -- 3. Capture state AFTER execution completes
        command.playhead_time = timeline_state.get_playhead_time()
        command.selected_clip_ids = serialize_selection()

        -- 4. Save command with captured state
        command:save(db)
    end
end
```

**Key Point:** State capture at step 3 happens AFTER the command executor has finished all its work, including any playhead movements.

### Command Executor Responsibility

Commands that move the playhead must do so **inside the executor**, not in the keyboard shortcut handler:

```lua
-- ✅ CORRECT: Playhead movement inside command executor
command_executors["Insert"] = function(command)
    -- Create clip
    local clip = Clip.create(...)
    clip:save(db)

    -- Move playhead (if requested)
    if command:get_parameter("advance_playhead") then
        timeline_state.set_playhead_time(insert_time + duration)
    end

    return true  -- State will be captured AFTER this returns
end

-- ❌ WRONG: Playhead movement outside command
-- This would happen AFTER state capture, breaking the invariant
keyboard_shortcuts.handle_key = function(event)
    command_manager.execute(insert_cmd)  -- State captured here
    timeline_state.set_playhead_time(...)  -- TOO LATE!
end
```

---

## Undo/Redo Semantics

### Undo: Navigate to Previous State Checkpoint

```
Current position: Command 5
Press Cmd+Z:
  1. Clear all state (clips, etc.)
  2. Replay commands 1-4
  3. Restore state from Command 4's record:
     - playhead = command4.playhead_time
     - selection = command4.selected_clip_ids
  4. Result: Exact state as it was after Command 4 completed
```

### Redo: Navigate to Next State Checkpoint

```
Current position: Command 3
Press Cmd+Shift+Z:
  1. Clear all state
  2. Replay commands 1-4
  3. Restore state from Command 4's record
  4. Result: Exact state as it was after Command 4 completed
```

### Initial State: Replay to Zero

```
Press Cmd+Z until no commands remain:
  1. Clear all state
  2. Replay zero commands (skip replay step)
  3. Restore to initial state:
     - playhead = 0ms
     - selection = []
  4. Result: Clean slate
```

---

## Why Not Capture "Before" State?

Some event sourcing systems store both pre-state and post-state. We only store post-state because:

### 1. **Pre-State is Implicit**
The pre-state of command N is the post-state of command N-1. We don't need to store it twice.

```
Command 1 post-state: {playhead: 3000, clips: [A]}
Command 2 pre-state: {playhead: 3000, clips: [A]}  ← Redundant!
Command 2 post-state: {playhead: 6000, clips: [A, B]}
```

### 2. **Replay Reconstructs Pre-State**
To get the state before command N, we replay up to command N-1:

```
Want state before Command 3?
  → replay(commands[1..2])
  → Get exact state from Command 2's record
```

### 3. **Matches Professional NLE Behavior**
FCP7, FCPX, and Avid all work this way: undo takes you to "after the previous command", not "before the current command."

---

## Edge Cases

### Edge Case 1: Zero Commands (Initial State)

```lua
-- replay_events(target = 0)
if target_sequence_number == 0 then
    -- No commands to replay
    timeline_state.set_playhead_time(0)
    timeline_state.set_selection({})
    return true
end
```

The initial state (before any commands) is defined as:
- Playhead at 0ms
- Empty selection
- Whatever clips existed before the command system started (if any)

### Edge Case 2: Command That Doesn't Move Playhead

```lua
-- SplitClip command
command_executors["SplitClip"] = function(command)
    -- Split clip into two pieces
    local clip1 = ...
    local clip2 = ...
    clip1:save(db)
    clip2:save(db)

    -- Playhead NOT moved
    return true
end

-- State captured:
-- playhead = wherever it was before (unchanged)
-- This is correct! The playhead position after this command
-- is the same as before it.
```

If a command doesn't move the playhead, the captured playhead position will be the same as the previous command's. This is correct—it means "playhead stayed put."

### Edge Case 3: Selection Changes During Command

```lua
-- User has clip A selected
-- INSERT command creates clip B
-- Command does NOT change selection
-- State captured: selection = [A]  ← Still selected

-- Later, OVERWRITE deletes clip A
-- Command executor doesn't touch selection
// State captured: selection = [A]  ← Stale reference!

// During undo/restore:
for _, clip_id in ipairs(selected_ids) do
    local clip = Clip.load(clip_id, db)
    if clip then  // ← clip A doesn't exist anymore
        table.insert(selected_clips, clip)
    end
end
// Result: selection = []  ← Automatically cleaned up
```

The replay system automatically filters out deleted clips from selection, maintaining the invariant that selection only contains clips that actually exist.

---

## Testing the Invariant

### Test 1: State Checkpoints are Complete

```
Execute: F9, F9, F9 (three inserts)
Verify:
  - Command 1: {playhead: 3000, selection: [], clips: [A]}
  - Command 2: {playhead: 6000, selection: [], clips: [A,B]}
  - Command 3: {playhead: 9000, selection: [], clips: [A,B,C]}

Undo to Command 2:
  - Replay commands 1-2
  - Restore: playhead=6000, selection=[], clips=[A,B]
  ✅ Exact match to after Command 2
```

### Test 2: Playhead Movement is Captured

```
Execute: F9 (INSERT at 0ms)
Verify:
  - Before execution: playhead=0
  - Command executor: moves playhead to 3000
  - State captured: playhead=3000  ← Includes movement
  - After execution: playhead=3000

Undo:
  - Replay zero commands
  - Restore: playhead=0
  ✅ Back to initial state
```

### Test 3: Selection Survives Undo/Redo

```
Execute: F9, select clip1, F9
Verify:
  - Command 2: {playhead: 6000, selection: [clip1], clips: [clip1, clip2]}

Undo:
  - Replay command 1
  - Restore: {playhead: 3000, selection: [], clips: [clip1]}
  ✅ Selection cleared (clip1 was selected in Command 2's state)

Redo:
  - Replay commands 1-2
  - Restore: {playhead: 6000, selection: [clip1], clips: [clip1, clip2]}
  ✅ Selection restored (clip1 selected again)
```

## Benefits of This Invariant

### 1. **Predictable Undo Behavior**
Users know exactly what to expect: each undo step takes you to a complete previous state, not a partial one.

### 2. **Stateless Replay**
Event replay doesn't need to track intermediate states. Just replay commands sequentially and restore the final captured state.

### 3. **Automatic Cleanup**
Stale references (deleted clips in selection) are automatically filtered during restoration. No special cleanup code needed.

### 4. **Session Persistence for Free**
The same state capture used for undo/redo also works for session persistence. The sequences table stores the "current" state checkpoint.

### 5. **Matches Professional NLEs**
FCP7, FCPX, and Avid all use this model. Users coming from those tools will find the behavior familiar.

## Summary

The **state checkpoint invariant** ensures that:

```
∀ N: State(N) = exact state after Command N completed
```

This means:
- ✅ Playhead position is part of the command's effects
- ✅ Selection state is part of the command's effects
- ✅ Undo restores complete previous states, not partial ones
- ✅ Replay is deterministic and stateless
- ✅ Matches FCP7/FCPX/Avid behavior exactly

The implementation enforces this invariant by:
1. Moving playhead changes inside command executors
2. Capturing state AFTER command execution completes
3. Restoring complete state during replay
4. Automatically filtering stale references

**This is the foundation of the entire undo/redo system.**
