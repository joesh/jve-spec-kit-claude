# SESSION STATE - JVE Video Editor Implementation

**Date**: 2025-09-27  
**Session Focus**: Architectural fixes and sequence model corrections

## Current Status: MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL FIXES COMPLETED - SEQUENCE FOUNDATION SOLID

### Major Architectural Fixes Completed This Session:

#### âœ… **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL FIX: Sequence Canvas Model**
- **Problem**: Sequence implementation deviated from specification - included width/height when spec didn't define them
- **Analysis**: User correctly identified that sequences need canvas resolution for professional video editing
- **Solution**: Updated both specification AND implementation to align with professional NLE patterns
- **Result**: Sequences now have mutable canvas settings (width/height) with no model-level defaults

#### âœ… **SPECIFICATION CORRECTIONS**
- **Updated data-model.md**: Added canvas width/height fields to Sequence entity
- **Removed stored duration**: Duration is now calculated from rightmost clip position (professional standard)
- **Added derived properties**: Clarified calculated vs stored fields
- **Schema updated**: Added width/height constraints, removed duration column

#### âœ… **TEST SUITE RESTORATION** 
- **Fixed compilation errors**: Updated all Sequence::create() calls across test files
- **Fixed test logic**: Updated expectations for calculated duration, canvas resolution  
- **Result**: 15/15 sequence tests now pass (100% success rate)

#### âœ… **TRACK COUNT IMPLEMENTATION**
- **Fixed track counting**: Implemented proper cached track count management
- **Root cause**: Cache initialized to -1 but add methods only incremented if >= 0
- **Solution**: Initialize cache to 0 for new sequences, remove conditional increments
- **Result**: Track management tests now pass correctly

### All Core Systems Implemented (T015-T024):

5. **Media Pipeline**: Add video/audio decoding and preview rendering
6. **Export System**: Implement rendering pipeline for final output

### Context for Future Claude:
This is JVE Video Editor M1 Foundation - a hackable, script-forward video editor (like Emacs for video). This session focused on critical architectural corrections after user feedback identified specification deviations.

**ðŸŽ¯ MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL CORRECTIONS COMPLETED**:
- **Specification Alignment**: Sequence model corrected to match professional video editing standards
- **Canvas Resolution**: Added mutable width/height to sequences (no model-level defaults)
- **Duration Calculation**: Changed from stored to calculated duration (professional standard)
- **Real Frame Rates**: Fixed to support professional framerates (23.976, 29.97, etc.)
- **Track Count Management**: Fixed cache initialization and increment logic
- **Test Suite Recovery**: All 15 sequence tests now pass (100% success rate)

**Key Architectural Insights Gained**:
- User correctly identified that sequences need canvas resolution for professional video editing
- Duration should be calculated from clips, not stored (matches Avid/Resolve/Premiere)
- Model-level defaults violated separation of concerns (caller should provide defaults)
- Cached values need proper initialization to work with increment-only logic

**Current Priority**: The sequence foundation is now architecturally sound. Next focus should be on debugging remaining persistence test failures and completing the full test suite verification. The core architecture is solid and follows professional video editing patterns correctly.
