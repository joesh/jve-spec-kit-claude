description: Create or update the feature specification from a natural language feature description.

The user input to you can be provided directly by the agent or as a command argument - you **MUST** consider it before proceeding with the prompt (if not empty).

User input:

$ARGUMENTS

The text the user typed after `/specify` in the triggering message **is** the feature description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `$ARGUMENTS` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

Given that feature description, do this:

1. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json "$ARGUMENTS"` from repo root and parse its JSON output for BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE. All file paths must be absolute.
  **IMPORTANT** You must only ever run this script once. The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for.
2. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.
3. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.
4. Report completion with the feature name (BRANCH_NAME), spec file path, and readiness for the next phase.

Note: The script scaffolds the spec folder/file and records the active feature, but does NOT create or check out a branch. Spec authoring (and /plan, /tasks) happens on the current branch (normally master). The feature branch is cut later by /implement (`start-feature-branch.sh`). Do not switch branches during /specify.
